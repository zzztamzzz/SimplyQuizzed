# SimplyQuizzed
My personal USCIS trainer. I made this so that I can better prepare myself for my upcoming USCIS appointment. 

# Game Rules
This is the same as the rules outlined on the USCIS website. Mine are only gamified. 
- There are 100 questions to consider, and the game will select 10 out of the total randomly for every round of the game. 
- Once you get the majority of the questions correct, you win the game, i.e. you pass the question part of your appointment.
- You will be competing against the clock. Once the timer runs out, you have to restart.
- No skipping questions. You must choose your answers before proceeding to the next question. You also cannot go back to modify your choices for previous questions.
- You will not see the results until you reach the end of the question set, unless all the questions you have answered so far has been correct.
- By default, if you correctly respond to 60% of the questions, you will win. You can choose to exit or continue to Frenzy mode (check below for details).

# Game Structure
I have decided to make this so that it is a Multiple Choice Question and Answer (MCQA), since there can be more than one correct answers to some questions. For every question, you will select the choices presented to you on screen and then proceed to the next question. 

# Frenzy mode (to be implemented)
`Frenzy mode` is something that I thought would be a challenge to myself. This mode can be selected once you win your current game. You will compete against the a timer, which will continue to go down. If your choice is correct, you will gain time, for incorrect you get penalized. This mode will show you how many answers you get correct so that you can keep track of your progress. In this mode, the questions will be selected randomly from the total of 100. 

# Word Of Warning
Keep in mind that some responses are about to change depending on what year you are looking at this. My appointment is in 2024 so I have built this game with responses that are valid for the year or term.
You have been warned.
